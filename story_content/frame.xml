non-formal learning part of that process. language learning in a formal classroom setting has been taken care of. we know how we have to do that efficiently and effectively but all too often our model of 2nd language acquisition still is: ‘go to school’.  this ‘in school’ classroom situation is quite artificial. the purpose should be that learners use the language as a means, that language proficiency can be applied in everyday life. and that is where the non-formal learning comes in. putting formal language learning first and practice in the outside world almost as an afterthought  is quite detrimental. 2nd language learners learn in direct contact with their environment,  in the outside world where all the language and opportunities to practice are available. participating in society provides the 2nd language learner with meaningful language, relevant in that society. people with migration background literally live within their learning environment and learn in their living environment. bridging formal and non-formal learning </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6mK9ayIQhB8.6dS1Wf17m1i" slidebank="false" type="slide"> teachers don’t have to create a strong learning environment, society is one. in this regard 2nd language learning is considered a process of ‘creative construction’. in this social constructivist view 2nd language acquisition is the result of interaction between the learner and the environment. the learner and the environment have their own specific role in this interaction. the environment provides the language require to function. the learner captures the message and its meaning and gradually structures language out of the language context. non-formal, outside the classroom learning is crucial. commuting between the classroom and the outside world is key in 2nd language learning as part of the integration process.  interaction between learner and environment </slidetext><slidetext slideid="6mK9ayIQhB8.61jKyrT8sIt"

of telling stories with a variety of multimedia, including graphics, audio, video, and web publishing. read more about the educational use of digital storytelling here. watch this interesting video concerning the use of digital storytelling. the target group for this good practice activity are students studying l2 in adult education centres. the organisations visited schools and invited students to participate in the digital storytelling project. the process starts with the introduction during the lessons (3 hours). the method was chosen because the organization had used it before in

adapted by other organisations: the practice can be replicated easily by other organisations, in other countries and in other cultures, since the topics encountered are universal. in addition, the learners just need to be informed on time about the order of discussion so that they have enough time to prepare themselves with relevant information necessary for discussion.  the activity can be organised in a different setting (e.g. in a restaurant, a café or a theatre etc.).  an e-learning perspective could bring an added value to this practice in terms of sharing unique stories about so

activity is to improve the learners’ active listening, speaking and writing skills through the introduction of humour and cooperation with other learners in the classroom. in this regard the activity offers additional richness in language learning and teaching by encouraging active participation as it increases the learners’ willingness to communicate thoughts and feelings. at the same time, the non-formal activity encourages use of imagination and creativity and cooperation between learners in a relaxed learning environment. the piloted non-formal activity gives the learners an opportunity to reflect on their own concerns, perceptions and values. listening to the stories of other learners presents an opportunity to reflect on the perceptions of others and to respond to those reflections. by being creative rather than imitative, learners sharpen their observation and encourage their curiosity. they see the possibilities of new relationships between bits of information and learn to be able to do something about their perceptions and have the confidence in themselves to do it.    working with anecdotes: goals? piloting experience from macedonia </slidetext><slidetext

memorable context for learning. an anecdote may wake up sleepy students, engage unmotivated ones with the task, and reinforce a context so it is not easily forgotten.  sharing anecdotes gives learners the chance to reflect on their own and on others' concerns, perceptions, and values.  when an anecdote is told or when it is about an experience taken from the country, the anecdote provides cultural information. additionally, while students learn more about each other and their teacher, the teacher learns more about the students. anecdotes therefore reinforce the friendly relationship between teachers and students and among the students themselves. working with anecdotes: link between formal and non-formal learning? piloting experience from macedonia </slidetext><slidetext

interpretative strategies. it is more than a way of exchanging information and extending ideas, it is their means of reaching out and connecting with other people. the activity can link not only between the world of classroom and home but also between the classroom and beyond. anecdotes provide a common thread that can help unite cultures and provide a bridge across the cultural gap. working

literary form. they empathized with and discussed the feelings of the characters and the dilemmas they overcame. and they listen to language and experience the power of the spoken word.  one of the greatest outcomes of the activity is that it inspires students to create their own stories. this experience adds new dimensions to language and literacy learning. students can communicate their

particular students who tend to dominate (or lead) the group discussions in general. public speaking shyness, even in examples (such as the ones presented in this report) where the students are
